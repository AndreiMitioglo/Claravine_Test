"# Claravine_Test"
Claravine_Test API recommendation: First in Postman i'll check GET status code 200-succes,
 then I'll make sure that the end point is correct, responce body, headers and responce time. 
After testing manually I'll start automation in Java implementing Maven as a Build tool that is 
integrated with the dependencies like Rest Assured, Hamcrest for the simple assertion, Jackson for 
serialization, and Log4j for debugging, etc.
